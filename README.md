this project was really hard for me i ran into a lot of issues especially with getting the components to work together and making sure everything was typed right in typescript i went to bryans office hours on wednesday and he helped me a lot with understanding what i was doing wrong and how to fix it i was really looking forward to thursdays office hours because i still had some things i was stuck on but it ended up getting cancelled so i had to try and figure stuff out on my own i know the project isnt fully finished but i tried my best and learned a lot while working on it even though it was frustrating at times
